Hello! My name is Volodymyr. I'm 30 years old and I make my first steps in GitHub.
Yes, I still make some mistakes, but I think it's okay, isn't it?
I also have some hobbies, such as reading books, listening to music, sometimes cooking and playing with my lovely cat.

If we talk about books, I just wanna say that I'm really crazy in them. Especially if we talk about covers of books. Covers of some books are real art.
Bright or dark colors, magnificent fonts - beauty and one of the reason, why I have bougth so many books earlier.
I forgot to say that I hate noisy neighbours. Some of them are awful people.
